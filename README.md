As expected, keeping black cards until one can not place any other card improves one's odds at winning.

If all but last players would receive same number of wins they would have [68932, 69786] 95% confidence interval in the first case and [52639, 53480] in the second. Therefore when last player uses such a strategy it also improves first player's odds at winning.
